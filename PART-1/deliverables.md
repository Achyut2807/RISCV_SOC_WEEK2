## 1. What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that combines the core elements of a computer systemâ€”such as a processor, memory, input/output interfaces, and control logicâ€”onto a **single silicon chip**.  

This integration enables **smaller size, higher speed, lower power consumption, and faster communication** compared to multi-chip systems.  

SoCs are the foundation of most modern electronics including **smartphones, embedded controllers, and IoT devices**, where they bring together **hardware, firmware, and communication logic** in one compact unit.

## 2. Main Building Blocks of an SoC

An SoC is composed of several major subsystems that communicate via an internal interconnect network.

### **a. Processor / CPU Core**
- Acts as the **central control unit** of the SoC.  
- Executes program instructions and manages overall chip operations.  
- Common architectures include **RISC-V**, **ARM**, and **MIPS**.  
- Contains the ALU, control logic, and register files.

### **b. Memory Subsystem**
- Stores both instructions and data.  
- Typically includes:  
  - **Volatile memory (SRAM/DRAM)** â€“ temporary storage for runtime operations.  
  - **Non-volatile memory (ROM/Flash)** â€“ used for boot code and configuration data.

### **c. Peripheral Interfaces**
- Allow the SoC to communicate with the external world.  
- Examples include **UART**, **SPI**, **IÂ²C**, **Timers**, **GPIO**, and **ADC/DAC** modules.  
- Enable interaction with sensors, actuators, and communication devices.

### **d. Interconnect / Bus Fabric**
- Serves as the **data highway** connecting CPU, memory, and peripherals.  
- Common protocols: **AMBA (AHB/APB)** and **Wishbone**.  
- Handles signal timing, arbitration, and data flow management.

### **e. Clock and Reset Circuits**
- The **clock** synchronizes all sequential operations.  
- The **reset** brings every module into a defined startup state, ensuring reliable operation after power-up.

## 3. Purpose of the BabySoC Model

The **BabySoC** is a **simplified educational model** of a full-fledged SoC, used in the VSD learning journey to demonstrate essential system-level interactions.  

**Why itâ€™s valuable for learners:**
- Clearly illustrates how CPU, memory, and peripherals exchange data.  
- Removes unnecessary design complexity such as multi-core or pipeline logic.  
- Works seamlessly with **open-source EDA tools (Icarus Verilog and GTKWave)**.  
- Encourages hands-on learning through simulation of clocks, resets, and data signals.  

This simplified SoC bridges theory with practice and helps students build confidence before moving toward RTL or physical design.

## 4. Importance of Functional Modelling in SoC Design

**Functional Modelling** is carried out **before RTL implementation and layout** to ensure that every block in the system behaves as intended.

### **Goals**
- Verify the **logical correctness** of the design.  
- Catch communication or integration errors **early in the workflow**.  
- Use waveform analysis to study clock, reset, and data transitions.  
- Ensure the SoC architecture performs correctly before synthesis.

### **Tools Used**
- **Icarus Verilog (iverilog):** open-source Verilog compiler and simulator.  
- **GTKWave:** waveform viewer that reads `.vcd` (Value Change Dump) files to visualize signal transitions.

### **Typical Workflow**
1. Compile the BabySoC Verilog files using `iverilog`.  
2. Run the simulation to produce a `.vcd` file.  
3. Open the waveform in `gtkwave` to inspect reset, clock, and data flow.  

This stage acts as a **checkpoint between conceptual and RTL design**, validating design logic before physical implementation.

## 5. Summary

The **BabySoC** experiment provides an excellent foundation to understand:
- The structural organization of a typical SoC (CPU, memory, and peripherals).  
- The timing and synchronization between modules.  
- The significance of verifying functional behavior with **open-source tools**.  

By mastering BabySoC fundamentals, students establish a strong base to progress into **RTL design**, **synthesis**, and **physical design**, gaining a complete perspective of the SoC workflow.
