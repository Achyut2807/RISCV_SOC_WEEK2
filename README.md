## 1. Overview

Week 2 emphasizes building a strong foundation in **System-on-Chip (SoC)** architecture while gaining **practical exposure** to functional verification using open-source tools.

### **Learning Outcomes**
- Grasp the **architecture and core components** of an SoC.  
- Understand **data exchange** between CPU, Memory, and Peripherals.  
- Perform **functional simulation** using *Icarus Verilog* and visualize results with *GTKWave*.  
- Document findings through waveform-based observations and analysis.

This week is structured into two key segments â€” a **conceptual theory module** and a **hands-on simulation exercise**.

## 2. Part 1: Conceptual Understanding

**Objective:**  
Develop a theoretical understanding of SoC design flow using the simplified **BabySoC model**.

### **Included Topics**
- Definition and role of a **System-on-Chip (SoC)**  
- Breakdown of SoC elements: **CPU, Memory, Peripherals, Bus, Clock & Reset**  
- Purpose and advantages of the **BabySoC learning model**  
- Role of **functional modelling** before RTL design and physical implementation  
- Summary and interpretation of theoretical learnings

**Deliverable:**  
A Markdown report summarizing theoretical insights, supported by relevant diagrams and references.

## 3. Part 2: Hands-on Functional Modelling

**Objective:**  
Simulate and analyze BabySoC behavior using open-source tools to understand functional verification in SoC design.

### **Practical Steps**
- Compile BabySoC Verilog modules using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**.  
- Run simulations to generate `.vcd` waveform files.  
- Analyze **clock**, **reset**, and **dataflow** between CPU, Memory, and Peripherals using **GTKWave**.  
- Record observations and screenshots demonstrating each step.  

**Deliverables:**
- `sim.log` â€“ simulation log output  
- `.vcd` file â€“ waveform data  
- `screenshots/` â€“ waveform captures with captions  
- README â€“ short description of each observation and result
